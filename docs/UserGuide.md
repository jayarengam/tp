TAskmaster is a **desktop app for managing students, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a CS Teaching Assistant who can type fast, TAskmaster can help you track your students' attendance and class participation faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick Start

### Installation
1. Ensure you have Java 11 or later installed.
2. Download the jar file from the project website.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for the application.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. A GUI should appear, with the field bar to input commands. The list of commands are available below.

### Usage
1. Add the students that you are currently teaching into TAskmaster using the `add-student` command.
    * You can use the `list-students`, `edit-student`, `find-students` and `delete-student` commands to read and modify your student list.
2. Create a new session that represents a tutorial, lab or recitation session using the `add-session` command.
    * This session will read your student list and create a list of corresponding student records belonging to that session
    * Each student in the student list will be represented by a student record
    * This list of records, once created, will be **independent of the student list**. Any modifications to the student list after a session is created **will not** affect the student records in that session.
    * You can use the `delete-session` command to delete a session from the session list.
3. Mark your students' attendance and award them class participation marks with the `mark` and `score` commands respectively.
    * Note that you will not be allowed to use these commands outside of a session.

Example usages:
```

- The `SCORE` **must be a non-negative number** between 0 and 10, inclusive. 
Taskmaster supports detailed score up to 2 decimal places.
For scores with more than 2 decimal places, the score will be rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places.  
Taskmaster supports scoring students' participation score even though the student is absent, to allow for
module-specific instructions (e.g. a module coordinator instructs the TA to give
a participation mark of 6 if a valid MC is given)

To mark all students **who are present**, you can replace the `INDEX` by the keyword `all`.

Example Usage:
```
score 1 cp/5
score 3 cp/6.9
score 4 cp/4.21
score all cp/10
score all cp/2.94
```

### View lowest scoring students: `lowest-score`

### Get random student: `random-student`
Displays a random student from the current session
```
random-student
```
- Lists a random student from the current session.
- Does not work if the session has no students.

### Clearing all entries: `clear`
Clears all saved data in taskmaster (both students and sessions).
```
clear
```
- This will delete all students and all sessions (including student record data).

### Exiting the program: `exit`
Exits the program.

## Storage
The TAskmaster stores the running list of students and sessions automatically to JSON files when they are updated.

**Student data** is stored in `data/taskmaster.json`
**Session data** is stored in `data/session_list.json`

Avoid modifying the files as this may cause the program to read the input as invalid on startup and load with an
empty student list without any sessions.
